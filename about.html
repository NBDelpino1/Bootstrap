                    I am humble person who is eager to learn and willing to go the extra mile to succeed in this industry.
                    I just graduated from the UCF coding bootcamp with a good understanding of the fundamentals of Full Stack Web Development.

                    My strengths are in UI/UX. I truly enjoy the creative aspect of it. I come from a banking background however
                    I decided it was time to start doing something that would bring me joy at the end of the day instead of just a paycheck.
                    After much thought I decided on web development. I have always been intrigued by design and have a strong curiosity to
                    know how things work so web development seemed like a good fit. Ever since then it has been quite the journey but I love it.
                    I can spend hours doing this and it doesnâ€™t feel like work to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of my projects are coded with using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap or Materialize with a little jQuery. I took a liking for the PHP-Laravel
                    framework and plan on integrating it into all of my projects. Most projects are a work in progress and I continue
                    work on them whenever possible. In my spare time I also like fiddling around with front end frameworks.
